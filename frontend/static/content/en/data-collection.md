title: Data Collection Protocol
---

## Device Requirements

Each participant must use a Garmin device compatible with the [Nutrition Logger app](https://apps.garmin.com/apps/26c3b37a-505b-4ad8-b759-7568e88f5c93), which will help collect information during the activity. Download the app on your device and follow its instructions.

## Before Activity

Before starting the activity, you must record:

- ✓ Fatigue status (1-5 scale)
- ✓ Hydration status
- ✓ Sleep quality from previous night

## During Activity

During the activity, you'll record nutritional intake and effort level using the Nutrition Logger app on your Garmin device:

### Nutritional Metrics

- 💧 **Water**
- ⚡ **Electrolytes (sodium)**
- 🍎 **Food (calories)**

### Portion Guidelines

| Nutrient | Default Quantity | Estimated Tolerance |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| 💧 Water | 100ml | ±20ml |
| ⚡ Electrolytes (sodium) | 100mg | ±20mg |
| 🍎 Food | 100kcal | ±20kcal |

#### Example

If a participant consumes 200ml of low-calorie sports drink plus a 180kcal gel at a certain point, they should mark:

- Water: 2 portions
- Electrolytes: 1 portion (depending on drink and gel content, could be 2)
- Food: 2 portions

### Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE)

For practical purposes, we use a simplified 5-level scale instead of 10:

- **1-2**: Minimal activity (resting)
- **3-4**: Very light activity (very easy walk or jog)
- **5-6**: Moderate activity (trending to strong). Competition pace for long-duration activity.
- **7-8**: Very high activity. High pace that could only be sustained for a few minutes.
- **9-10**: Maximum possible effort. Duration of a few seconds.

### App Controls During Activity

- **START Button**: Add (+1) to selected item / Increase RPE
- **BACK Button**: Undo (-1) from selected item / Decrease RPE
- **UP/DOWN Buttons**: Cycle through data fields (RPE, Water, Electrolytes, Food, MENU)
- ℹ️ When on MENU, Start button opens Session Menu

## After Activity

After completing the activity, you must record:

**General sensation self-assessment (1-5 scale):**

1. Very bad
2. Bad
3. Normal
4. Good
5. Very good

## Upload Data

Once the activity is complete, sync your Garmin device and upload the .fit file through the Trail Fit Uploader platform, along with the contextual information requested.
